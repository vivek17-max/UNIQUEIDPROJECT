      <P> The Unique Identification Authority is a statutory authority established under the provisions of the UniqueID (Targeted Delivery
           of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (“unique Act 2016”) on 12 July 2016 by the Government of 
           India, under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The Aadhaar Act 2016 has been amended by the

        Under the unique Act 2016, UID is responsible for Aadhaar enrolment and authentication, including operation and management of 
        all stages of Aadhaar life cycle, developing the policy, procedure, and system for issuing Aadhaar numbers to individuals and
